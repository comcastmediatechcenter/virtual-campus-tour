    body: "Inworks is a dual campus innovation initiative that fosters collaboration among faculty, researchers, students, and community members. When you take an Inworks course, the process of innovation is demystified. Inside their prototyping labs, you can learn to 3D print, solder a circuit, or grow a biomaterial. Because it’s important to make things that matter, you’ll learn the human-centered design process; it will guide you as you move from problem to prototype. Students of all majors will find a place here."

    body: "This new laboratory, funded by the Office of Naval Research, allows electrical engineering department chair Stephen Gedney and his team to solidify the laws and physical properties of ferromagnetic materials (materials that have a high susceptibility to magnetization) and to develop physics-based mathematical models that describe them. While at sea, naval vessels endure tremendous changes in magnetic or mechanical stress encountered during maneuvering, from changing wave states and temperature variations, as well from the large changes in hydrostatic pressures experienced by underwater vehicles. The goal of this research facility is to be able to predict the magnetic state of a ship given the ship’s location, movement, stress, and thermal history."
